# 2026-02-15 — Day One

## First Boot
- Met Daedrien, owner of Spoiled Pets (ShopSpoiledPets.com)
- New small business owner, growing, wants AI agents to help run things
- Named me **Chat** 💬
- Setting up identity and getting oriented

## Three Big Automation Goals
Daedrien wants to automate three areas (focusing on #1 first):

### 1. Retailer Management (PRIORITY — starting here)
- Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lKT1vGE2qWrISCla9l-phFKjh_toIrDbF65xxqLqLuE/
- **KEY TAB: "Denver Metro Area Visits"** — the active outreach tab
  - Columns: #, Store Name, City, Address, Field Notes, (3 empty), Field Selections, Name, Position, Email, Telephone, Website, Status
  - Organized in route groups, each with own header row
  - Field Selections is a multi-select dropdown (Made contact, Interested, Not interested, Left samples, Left Contact Card, Grabbed Contact card, Circle Back IRL, 1st Email Sent, Call, Email Information, UTL)
  - Daedrien adding columns: Product Samples, Visit Date, Last Email Sent, Next Follow-up, Follow-up Count
- **Group 1 (visited this week):** Pet Spa, Chuck & Don's, Wag n Wash, Zoey's Place, Urban Sophisticats, Poodle Shop, Riley's Natural, Paw Prints
- **Group 2 (visited this week):** Black Paw, Dingo's, Doggie Style, Paws 'n' Play, Mouthfuls, SIMPAWTICO, Cosmo's, Pet World, Pets N' Stuff, Strutting Pup, Urban Dog Broomfield
- **Groups 3-4:** planned routes, not yet visited
- Other tabs: "All Stores" tab has CO/TX/NM/CA stores (86 total), plus a Distributors tab
- Outreach email: daedrien@shopspoiledpets.com
- Daedrien wants to approve emails before sending initially, autonomous later
- **Email cadence:** 1 week after visit → first follow-up, then every 2 weeks, max 5 follow-ups, then stop
- **Product line:** Freeze-dried meals & treats for cats and dogs
  - Balanced Bowls: Chicken & Veggies (dog), Chicken & Salmon (cat)
  - Treats: Salmon Filet Bites, Chicken Breast Bites, Pearl Whitefish Bites
  - Hydration enhancers: Feather & Fin, Coastal Pink, Golden Roost
  - Wild-caught salmon, cage-free chicken
  - Premium/luxury positioning, Colorado-based
- **Wants:**
  - Agent to scrape web for pet stores they're missing in various metros → add to sheet
  - Agent to send automated follow-up email sequences personalized with visit notes
  - Update the sheet after each email sent (centralized hub)

## Agent Architecture (Decided)
- **Retailer Agent** — checks sheet daily (~8:30am MST), determines next steps, drafts full emails, sends IRL revisit reminders (day before), reports to Chat only
- **Content Agent** (future) — TikTok/video automation
- **Affiliate Agent** (future) — UGC review, affiliate management
- **Chat (me)** — daily 9am MST brief to Daedrien on Telegram, queries all sub-agents
- Sub-agents talk to me only, not directly to Daedrien
- Retailer agent has read+write access to Google Sheet
- Full email drafts for approval (Daedrien approves before sending, eventually autonomous)
- Email cadence: 1 week after visit → first follow-up, then every 2 weeks, max 5, then stop
- IRL revisit reminders: day before

## Infrastructure Set Up
- Google Sheets webhook (Apps Script) deployed and tested — read + write confirmed
- Webhook URL stored in spoiled-pets/config.json
- Sheet columns: 1=#, 2=Store Name, 3=City, 4=Address, 5=Field Notes, 9=Field Selections, 10=Name, 11=Position, 12=Email, 13=Telephone, 14=Website, 15=Status, 16=Date Visited, 17=Last Email Sent, 18=Next Follow-Up, 19=Follow-up Count
- Daedrien already added columns 16-19 and filled in visit dates (2026-02-10)
- Note: Google Cloud service account keys were blocked by org policy; went with Apps Script webhook instead
- Note: Python urllib handles the Apps Script redirect correctly; curl does not (needs special handling)

### 2. Content Creation (FUTURE)
- Auto-posting TikToks, slideshows, generating scripts
- Reference tweet: https://x.com/oliverhenry/status/2022011925903667547
- Video editing automation

### 3. Affiliate / UGC Management (FUTURE)
- Reviewing affiliate applications, deciding who gets free product
- Creating Shopify orders for affiliate sends
- Reviewing UGC submissions for ad copy
