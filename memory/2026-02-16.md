## Content Pipeline Restructure (1:46pm)
- Daedrien wants EVERYTHING consolidated into the 9am morning briefing — no separate Telegram pings
- **Slideshow agent**: Now posts to TikTok drafts via PostBridge API, confirmation goes in daily brief
- **Video agent**: Paused (Seedance too expensive for now)
- **Image agent**: Results included in daily brief, not sent separately to Telegram
- PostBridge API key: configured in spoiled-pets/config.json (pb_live_...)
- TikTok account ID: 44681 (shopspoiledpets)
- PostBridge API add-on: $5/mo (on top of $14/mo base)
- Created: spoiled-pets/postbridge-api.md (API reference for sub-agents)
- Created: spoiled-pets/content/daily-reports/ directory
- Updated cron delivery: image + slideshow agents → delivery "none", daily brief now pulls their reports
- Updated daily brief cron to include content section (images for approval + slideshow confirmation)
