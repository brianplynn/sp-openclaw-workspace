## Email 1 — Post-Visit Introduction (Send: 1 week after visit)

**Subject:** Great meeting you — Spoiled Pets follow-up

Hi {{contact_name}},

This is Daedrien Leyva-Lynn, founder of Spoiled Pets. I stopped by {{store_name}} earlier this week and really enjoyed seeing your shop — {{visit_notes}}.

I left some samples and my contact info, and wanted to follow up with a bit more context.

**Spoiled Pets in a nutshell:**
We make freeze-dried meals and single-ingredient treats for cats and dogs. Everything is human-grade, HTST pasteurized, AAFCO approved, and made in small batches in the USA with wild-caught Alaskan salmon and cage-free Wisconsin chicken.

We're selective about where we sell — we're not on Amazon, not in big-box, and we don't undercut our retail partners online. Your customers get something they can't find anywhere else.

**What's in it for {{store_name}}:**
- 40–47% margins across the line
- A suggested first order under $450 that covers the full product line
- First-order perks: 20% off treats, 15% off meals, free customer samples, and free shipping over $250

I've attached our catalog and wholesale line sheet for reference. If you've had a chance to try the samples, I'd love to hear what you think. Happy to hop on a quick call or answer any questions over email.

**Three ways to order when you're ready:**

1. **Wholesale Portal** (preferred) — Create an account at ShopSpoiledPets.com using {{store_email}}, and let me know so I can grant wholesale access. Pricing and discounts apply automatically.

2. **Email/PO** — Send an order to brian@shopspoiledpets.com. We'll invoice with net 30 terms. ACH or credit card (3% processing fee).

3. **Faire** — Order at spoiledpets.faire.com (note: first-order discounts only available through options 1 & 2).

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,

## Email 2 — Gentle Check-In (Send: 2 weeks after Email 1)

**Subject:** Checking in — any thoughts on the samples?

Hi {{contact_name}},

Just wanted to circle back on my email from a couple weeks ago. I know things get busy, so no pressure at all.

If you (or your team) had a chance to try the Spoiled Pets samples I left at {{store_name}}, I'd genuinely love to hear what you thought — even if it's not a fit right now, feedback is always valuable.

A few things that might be helpful as you're thinking it over:

- **Our meals are HTST pasteurized** — we get asked about food safety a lot, and this is a big differentiator from other freeze-dried brands.
- **We're a local Colorado brand** — based right here in the Denver area, which makes restocking fast and communication easy.
- **We handle marketing support** — shelf talkers, floor displays, social media assets, and education packets are all available through our wholesale portal at no extra cost.

Happy to answer any questions or set up a quick 10-minute call if that's easier. What works best for you?

Warm regards,

## Email 3 — Value Proposition (Send: 2 weeks after Email 2)

**Subject:** Why stores are choosing Spoiled Pets

Hi {{contact_name}},

I wanted to share a quick update — we've been growing our retail partnerships across Colorado and the response from store owners has been really encouraging.

Here's what we keep hearing:

🐾 **"My customers can't find this anywhere else."** We don't sell on Amazon or in chain stores. When someone discovers Spoiled Pets at {{store_name}}, they come back to *you* to restock.

🐾 **"The packaging sells itself."** Our modern, shelf-ready design catches eyes in-store and looks great on social media — stores that tag us get reshared to our audience.

🐾 **"The margins actually work."** 40–47% margins with consistent reorders. No price erosion from online discounting.

If you're open to it, I'd love to send over a sample kit for your team to try — or we could set up a small intro order with our first-order discount (full line for under $450). Either way, zero pressure.

Let me know what you think!

Warm regards,
Daedrien Leyva-Lynn

## Email 4 — Social Proof + Soft Ask (Send: 2 weeks after Email 3)

**Subject:** Quick thought for {{store_name}}

Hi {{contact_name}},

I'll keep this short — I know your inbox is full.

We recently launched our complete Balanced Bowls (freeze-dried meals for cats and dogs), and the reception from both stores and pet parents has been really exciting. They're AAFCO approved for all life stages, made with whole functional ingredients — no synthetic vitamin premixes.

I genuinely think {{store_name}} would be a great home for the brand. Your shop's vibe aligns perfectly with what we're building, and I'd love to make it easy for you to try us out.

If a full order feels like too big a commitment right now, I'm happy to send a **sample kit** ($20 for the treat sampler or $40 for the full line) so your team and customers can experience the products firsthand.

Would that be helpful?

Warm regards,
Daedrien Leyva-Lynn

I don't want to be that person who keeps filling up your inbox, so this will be my last follow-up for a while.

I still believe Spoiled Pets would be a great fit at {{store_name}}, and if the timing or circumstances change down the road, I'd love to revisit the conversation. We're growing steadily and always looking to support local retailers who share our values.
