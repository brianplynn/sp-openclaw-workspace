    "prompt": "Casual smartphone photo of a modern kitchen counter with two black pet food bags (one with yellow accents, one with pink accents) sitting next to a fruit bowl, a stack of mail, and a half-drunk glass of water. Caught-in-the-wild aesthetic, like someone just set the bags down after shopping. Shot on iPhone 13, slightly tilted angle, warm afternoon light, slight lens flare from the window. Messy real-life background, UGC aesthetic, not staged.",
