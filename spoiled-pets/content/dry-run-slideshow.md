### CAPTION:
Your dog's food is cooked at 400°F. Here's why that's a problem. 👇

Most kibble is processed at extreme temperatures that destroy the nutrients your pet actually needs. Freeze-drying keeps 97% of the good stuff — no heat, no fillers, no mystery ingredients.

Spoiled Pets freeze-dried meals: wild-caught Alaskan salmon, cage-free Wisconsin chicken. 3 ingredients. Human-grade. AAFCO approved.

Just add water and watch the magic. ✨
