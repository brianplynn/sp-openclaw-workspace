## Image Generation Feedback

### 2026-02-16 — Dry Run (GPT Image 1)
**Prompt:** "Close-up overhead photo of dry brown kibble dog food in a plain stainless steel bowl..."
**Result:** Approved (usable) — but noted as "a bit obvious" as AI
**Lesson:** Need more imperfection, natural messiness, realistic phone camera artifacts

**Prompt:** "Beautiful appetizing photo of rehydrated freeze-dried pet food in a ceramic bowl..."
**Result:** Approved (usable) — AI-obvious
**Lesson:** Same — too clean, too perfect. Real UGC has slight blur, uneven lighting, background clutter

**Prompt:** "Adorable golden retriever puppy happily eating from a bowl of fresh wholesome food..."
**Result:** Approved (usable) — AI-obvious
**Lesson:** Dogs are hardest — fur texture, eye reflections give it away. Try more environmental context, partial views, slightly off-center framing

### General Lessons Learned
- Add "shot on iPhone 13" or "slightly blurry" to prompts for more realistic feel
- Include minor imperfections: crumbs on counter, slightly messy background, uneven lighting
- Avoid perfectly centered compositions — real UGC is often off-center
- Pet close-ups work better than full body (less AI-obvious fur)
- Product-focused shots (flat lays, counter scenes) are more convincing than pet portraits
- Dark/moody lighting hides AI artifacts better than bright even lighting
