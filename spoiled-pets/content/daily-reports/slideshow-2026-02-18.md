CAPTION:
Most cats are chronically dehydrated. And their food is making it worse. 💧

Cats evolved as desert hunters — they have a naturally low thirst drive and were designed to get moisture from prey. But kibble? It's only about 10% moisture. Cats actually need 60-70% moisture in their diet.

Chronic dehydration leads to kidney disease, urinary crystals, and UTIs — the #1 reasons for vet visits in cats.

Spoiled Pets freeze-dried meals rehydrate to 70%+ moisture, giving your cat the hydration they actually need. Just add water and watch the magic. ✨
