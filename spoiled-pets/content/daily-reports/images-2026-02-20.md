**Notes for Daily Brief:**
- Applied feedback from 2/18: detailed product descriptions (color blocking, cartoon faces, specific textures) instead of generic bag descriptions
- Used moody/warm lighting and added imperfections (crumbs, blur, clutter) per feedback
- Mix of categories: 1 ingredient, 1 product flat lay, 1 bowl/meal prep, 1 lifestyle, 1 pet+product
- Cat image uses partial view (nose + paw only) to minimize AI-obvious fur issues
