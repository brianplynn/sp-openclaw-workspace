CAPTION:
Your pet's food is legally classified as "feed-grade." Here's what that means. 👀

Feed-grade pet food is made in facilities that aren't held to human food safety standards. That means lower quality control, mystery ingredients, and processing methods that destroy nutrients.

Human-grade is different. It means every ingredient and every step of production meets the same standards as the food YOU eat. Spoiled Pets is made in a USDA-inspected human food facility in Wisconsin — HTST pasteurized, AAFCO approved, and made with real, whole ingredients you can actually recognize.

Your pet deserves better than "feed-grade." 🐾
