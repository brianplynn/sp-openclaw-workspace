**Notes:**
- Applied all feedback from prompt-feedback.md: more imperfections, off-center framing, iPhone aesthetic, background clutter
- Used detailed brand reference for bag descriptions (color blocking, cartoon faces) instead of generic descriptions
- Bowl shot uses correct freeze-dried texture (porous, irregular tan chunks) not smooth kibble
- Cat image uses partial view (paw + nose only) per feedback that full animals are too AI-obvious
- Ingredient close-up (salmon) is lowest AI-detection risk per past lessons
