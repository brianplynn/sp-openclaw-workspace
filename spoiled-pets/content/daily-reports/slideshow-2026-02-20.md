CAPTION:
Raw food has bacteria. Freeze-dried doesn't. 🧊

If you've been eyeing raw diets for your pet, you already know the nutrition is superior to kibble. But here's the part nobody talks about — raw food carries real risks. Salmonella. E. coli. Listeria. For your pet AND your family.

Freeze-dried food gives you all the raw nutrition with zero bacteria risk. Spoiled Pets meals are HTST pasteurized and AAFCO approved — human-grade ingredients, locked-in nutrients, no pathogens. Just add water and serve.

Same benefits. None of the risk. 🐾
