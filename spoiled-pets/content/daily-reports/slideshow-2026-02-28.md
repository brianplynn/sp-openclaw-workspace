CAPTION:
What's actually in canned pet food? 🥫👀

That can of "premium" pet food? It's 78% water. You're literally paying for moisture and fillers.

Canned food is cooked at extreme temperatures, destroying the nutrients your pet actually needs. Then they add synthetic vitamins back in to meet minimum standards.

Freeze-dried food locks in 97% of the original nutrients — real meat, real nutrition, nothing artificial. Spoiled Pets uses HTST pasteurization and only human-grade, single-ingredient recipes. Wild-caught Alaskan salmon. Cage-free Wisconsin chicken. That's it.

Your pet deserves better than rehydrated mystery meat. 🐾
