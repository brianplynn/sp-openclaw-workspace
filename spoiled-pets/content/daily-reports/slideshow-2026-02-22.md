CAPTION:
Your pet's dull coat isn't genetics — it's dinner. 🐾

Most kibble is cooked at extreme temperatures that destroy the omega fatty acids your pet needs for healthy skin and a shiny coat. Freeze-drying preserves those nutrients exactly as nature intended.

Our wild-caught Alaskan salmon is packed with omega-3 and omega-6 — the same fatty acids vets recommend for coat health. Pet parents tell us they see a difference in as little as 2 weeks.

HTST pasteurized. AAFCO approved. Human-grade. 🐟✨
