**Notes:**
- Applied feedback lessons: strong UGC imperfections, iPhone-shot framing, off-center compositions, environmental clutter
- Used detailed brand visuals (yellow/black dog bag, black/pink treat pouch with cat face, gold-label hydration jar)
- Avoided full pet portraits per feedback — used partial cat paw view for image 5
- Ingredient close-up (image 1) should be hardest to detect as AI per past feedback
