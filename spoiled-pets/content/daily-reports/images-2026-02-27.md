**Notes:** Applied feedback from previous batches — emphasized moody/warm lighting, imperfect compositions, environmental clutter, and detailed product descriptions matching actual packaging. Used partial pet view (paw only) for the cat shot to avoid obvious AI fur artifacts. Ingredient close-up (salmon) should be hardest to detect as AI.
