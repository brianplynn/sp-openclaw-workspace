CAPTION:
Not all chicken is created equal. 🐔

98% of chicken in the US comes from factory farms. That means cramped cages, antibiotics, and stressed animals. The quality of the meat? It shows.

Spoiled Pets uses cage-free Wisconsin chicken — birds that actually had room to move, forage, and live. Then we freeze-dry it to lock in all the protein and nutrients without cooking them away.

Our single-ingredient chicken treats? Literally just chicken. Nothing else. No fillers, no preservatives, no mystery powders.

SOUND SUGGESTION: Trending educational/documentary-style sound or clean beat — something that matches the "exposé" vibe of factory farming stats
