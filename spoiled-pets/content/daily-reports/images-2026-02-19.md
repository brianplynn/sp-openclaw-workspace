**Notes:**
- Applied feedback from Feb 18: used detailed product visual descriptions (color blocking, cartoon faces, specific accents) instead of generic bag descriptions
- Leaned into UGC imperfections: off-center framing, background clutter, slight blur, natural lighting
- Mixed all 5 categories for variety
- Ingredient close-up (salmon) should be hardest to detect as AI per past feedback
- Cat paw partial view (img5) avoids full-body AI animal issues
