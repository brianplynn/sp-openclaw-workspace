CAPTION:
My cat got diabetes from "premium" kibble. Here's what happened next. 🐱💔

Dallas was my best friend. When the vet told me his diabetes was caused by his food — the expensive stuff I thought was keeping him healthy — I was devastated.

I started reading labels. "Meat meal." "By-products." "Corn gluten." This was premium?

I couldn't find food I actually trusted. So I created Spoiled Pets — freeze-dried, human-grade, HTST pasteurized meals made with real ingredients. Wild-caught Alaskan salmon. Cage-free Wisconsin chicken. Nothing hidden.

Dallas inspired every product we make. Your pet deserves food you can actually trust. 🖤
