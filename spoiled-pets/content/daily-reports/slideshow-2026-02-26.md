CAPTION:
Your pet's food transition is failing. Here's why. 🐾

Going cold turkey on a new food is the #1 mistake pet parents make. Your pet's gut needs time to adjust — even when the new food is better.

Here's the 10-day freeze-dried transition plan that actually works:
📅 Days 1-3: 25% new, 75% old
📅 Days 4-7: 50/50 mix
📅 Days 8-10: 75% freeze-dried
📅 Day 11+: Full freeze-dried

Spoiled Pets freeze-dried meals make this easy — just rehydrate and mix. HTST pasteurized, AAFCO approved, human-grade ingredients your pet will actually love.
