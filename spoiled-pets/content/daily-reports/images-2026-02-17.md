5. **Lifestyle / Kitchen Scene (E)** — Both products on counter with everyday clutter, just-got-home vibe
   Prompt: "Casual smartphone photo of a modern kitchen counter with two black pet food bags (one with yellow accents, one with pink accents) sitting next to a fruit bowl, a stack of mail, and a half-drunk glass of water. Caught-in-the-wild aesthetic, like someone just set the bags down after shopping. Shot on iPhone 13, slightly tilted angle, warm afternoon light, slight lens flare from the window. Messy real-life background, UGC aesthetic, not staged."

**Notes:** Applied all feedback from 2/16 — added more imperfections (crumbs, stray hair, blurry edges, tilted angles), used moody/warm lighting instead of even lighting, avoided full pet portraits (used partial cat paw instead), included background clutter in every shot. Covered all 5 categories today (A through E).
