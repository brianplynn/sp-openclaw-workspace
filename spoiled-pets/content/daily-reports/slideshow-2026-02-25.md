CAPTION:
We said NO to Amazon. Here's why. 🚫📦

Big-box retailers demand massive margins — sometimes 60% or more. That means brands either cut corners on quality or jack up prices. We weren't willing to do either.

Spoiled Pets was built for independent pet stores — the ones where the staff actually knows your dog's name. The ones that care about what goes on the shelf.

Every bag of our freeze-dried food is HTST pasteurized, AAFCO approved, and made with wild-caught Alaskan salmon and cage-free Wisconsin chicken. Human-grade, not feed-grade.

We choose our retail partners the same way we choose our ingredients: carefully. 🐾
