## CAPTION:
Your dog's kibble is cooked at 400°F. Here's why that matters. 🔥

Most commercial pet food is heat-processed at extreme temperatures — destroying up to 60% of the natural vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids your pet needs to thrive. That's why you have to add synthetic nutrients back in.

Freeze-drying is different. It preserves raw nutrition without heat damage. Every bag of Spoiled Pets is HTST pasteurized, AAFCO approved, and made with human-grade ingredients you can actually see — wild-caught Alaskan salmon, cage-free Wisconsin chicken, real vegetables.

No fillers. No mystery "meat meal." Just real food, made in small batches.
