**Notes:** Today's mix covers all 5 categories (A–E). Applied feedback from prior batches: moody/uneven lighting, off-center framing, environmental clutter, partial pet views, and detailed brand-accurate bag descriptions (color blocking + cartoon animal faces, no text). Ingredient close-up (salmon) should be hardest to detect as AI.
